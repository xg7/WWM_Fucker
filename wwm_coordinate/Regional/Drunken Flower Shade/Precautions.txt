For the "Encounters" section, simply talk to the people next to you. It's not about dialogue; it's about eavesdropping or something else. Use your brain a little and you can complete it.

If you teleport to the NPC and they're not there, even after adjusting the time, exit to the title screen and re-enter to refresh. Some encounters in "Drunken Flower Shade" have prerequisite dialogues; if you miss one, teleport to the next. Some require three or four dialogues.

For "Serendipity" and "Injustices," I only teleport to the trigger location; complete them yourself.

For other tasks like archery and chess, find them on the map and complete them.
