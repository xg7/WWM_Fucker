Some coordinates might appear identical due to the software not refreshing, but others are fine. I've noted the solutions in the punctuation; for those that don't, please check the corresponding sections in the video.

For the encounters, simply talk to the people next to you. It's either a conversation, eavesdropping, or something else; a little thought will do.

If you teleport to the NPC and they're not there, even after adjusting the time, exit to the title screen and re-enter to refresh. Some encounters in "Drunken Flower Shade" require prerequisite dialogues; if the dialogue isn't present, you'll be teleported to the next one. Some require three or four dialogues.

For serendipitous encounters and injustices, I only teleport to the trigger location. Do it yourself.

For other archery and chess questions, just find them on the map and do them.
